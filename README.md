# Discord Bot for Contact Requests

## Description

The Discord Bot for Contact Requests is a personal tool that enables me to view contact requests from my portfolio website on my own Discord server. Built using discord.js and Express, this bot allows visitors to submit contact requests through my website, which includes name, email, phone, and message.

## Try it out!

You can access the contact form by going to my website https://shayanf.tech/, and navigating to the Contact page. From there, you can send a message to me, and I will receive it via Discord and reply to you by email.
